## Echeveria
#### He/Him

### Bio
Echeveria is a young swordsman, and the first soul that Tobi brought to the Interdimension. He died in the process of saving his world from an extradimensional threat, catching Tobi's eye in the process. Now, he resides in the Interdimension. Tobi and Hero form an inseperable pair, having known each other for years. The nature of their relationship is rather complicated, with Tobi being aroace and Hero having feelings for them. They have worked through this healthily, and are in a close queer-platonic relationship :)

Echeveria is the only member of the four who cannot use magic, however he makes up for it in his swordsmanship, agility and quick mind. He has taken down powerful magic users with a sword alone. Despite this, he feels a bit inadequate among the spellcasters.

Hero left his original world with unfinished business. He wants to move on, however he still finds elements of the past catching up to him (sounds a bit cringey when i write it out lmao). He isn't the happiest of people, smiling infrequently. Prior to the arrival of Cyte and Agatha, Tobi is the only person he trusts. His hobbies are music and poetry.
