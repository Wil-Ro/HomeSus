## Some important notes:
---
1. all characters should be 456x700 ideally, 700 is definitely the hight you need, but if you need to make it wider thats fine
2. all characters image files should be in lower case, ideally in the format ```<character name> <emotion shown>.png``` or jpg or whatever, for example ```sans happy.png``` or ```sans sad.png```
3. all backgrounds should be in the form ```bg <place name>.png``` or jpg or whatever, for example ```"bg school.png"``` or ```"bg space.png"```
4. all numbers used in positioning images in the scripts should be decimal, so 1.0 or 0.2, if its a whole number it wont work
