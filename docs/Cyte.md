## Cyte
#### They/Them

### Bio
Cyte is a biochemist and a strong proponent of bodily autonomy. Young, bright and a little eccentric, they are a viewed with suspicion in the scientific community as they are a fan of using their own body as a test subject. Their cells contain genetically engineered microorganisms which carry out a range of biochemical functions (a bit like mitochondria), and make Cyte "unnaturally" strong. 

They have fairly "childish" interests outside of science, such as getting around on a scooter. Cyte is a fan of any food and drink that looks and tastes like it gives you damage, partially because their modified cells require a lot of energy! You often see them drinking a huge cup of some brightly-coloured liquid or energy drink. Cyte adapts better to the Interdimension than Agatha when they arrive, however they struggle with homesickness later on.
