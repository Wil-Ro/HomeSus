## Tobi
#### They/Them

### Bio
Tobi is an ex-god with the power to give the dead a second chance. They are able to observe departed souls from other worlds and bring them into the Interdimension with a new body, selecting souls who belong to good people that deserve another shot at life. Agatha, Cyte and Echeveria are three of these souls. 

Tobi is a polite and rather eccentric individual, dressing smartly and talking with a "posh" accent, however they are kind and down-to-earth. They are the Professor of Mathematics at the University of the Interdimension, which is found in the realm's central city. Tobi was one of the young gods who lost their divinity as a punishment, and, instead of attempting to get it back, lives their life as a mortal. They strive to help people in the Interdimension, however they also want to find out about their past. They are also a decent wizard!

### Extra Lore
Way back when, the gods of the multiverse were struggling with their unruly children. A lot of the young gods did not settle down and find a domain, instead abusing their power and causing chaos. To punish them and hopefully help them mature, the gods decided to strip the troublemakers' souls of their divinity and confine them to the "wild west" of the Interdimension in hope that they would become sensible rulers of the realm. The young gods lost part of their souls, including most of their powers and memories. "Tobi", whose original name is long-forgotten, was one of these offending deities. They were one of the only ones who took their task seriously, and grew resentful of the others, who quickly became corrupt rulers of the Interdimension. They had all been promised the opportunity to have their divinity back if they behaved well, however Tobi decided to forfeit this opportunity. They left and lived life as a mortal, however later decide to try and find out more about their past
