## Cyte
#### She/Her

### Bio
Agatha is a theoretical physicist and is truly incredible at what she does. 

Despite her young age, she is shaping out to be one of the most influential physicists known to history. She is very disciplined and involved with her work, so others see her as a little intimidating. Despite this, she is kindhearted, and willing to help others or talk about her work. She appears very "sensible" compared to Cyte, wearing argle vests and drinking tea, but she shares a lot of "childish" interests as well! She's definitely a lot more mature than Cyte though. When arriving in the Interdimension, Agatha wants to go home right away. She later begins to adapt to her new surroundings, but to her, returning home remains a long-term goal. Agatha becomes a spellcaster as the story goes on. She uses her understanding of the physical laws of the world to manipulate them to her will.
